# Ralph Loop Run Log

## 2026-09-02T19:09:25Z - Queue initialization

- Reconciled the execution contract against the current worktree.
- Found that the generated queue contained 2,885 partition include occurrences while
  `header-progress.json` contains 1,403 unique authoritative header records.
- Adopted one queue row per authoritative ledger item. Partition membership remains
  aggregated on each row.
- The requested `scripts/Compare-ShiftLeftHeader.ps1` is not present in the branch.
  Until a header-scoped metadata comparator is added, closure evidence uses patch replay,
  annotation audits, existing full-architecture generation evidence, and focused consumer
  tests where the current windows-rs worktree permits them.

## 2026-09-02T19:35:00Z - Batch shared-handle-policy-01

- Headers: `minwindef.h`, `windef.h`, and `wtypes.h`.
- Removed cleanup ownership and invalid-handle metadata from resource/handle typedefs.
  Producer returns and output parameters remain the only ownership sites.
- Retained ABI-neutral `AlsoUsableFor` relationships for genuine native type
  interchangeability.
- Removed the obsolete `FreeWith`, `DoNotRelease`, and custom COM-out-pointer vocabulary.
- Regenerated cumulative patch artifacts for `minwindef.h` and `windef.h`; removed the
  obsolete `wtypes.h` ownership patch because the desired header is now the SDK baseline.
- Reverse patch checks pass and the three shared headers contain no `RAIIFree` or
  `InvalidHandleValue` type annotations.
- Existing evidence in `shift-left-metadata-worklog.md` records successful sequential
  x64, arm64, and x86 generation for the annotation/type-relation implementation.
- Current focused windows-rs validation is externally blocked before execution:
  `crates/tests/libs/clang/tests/header_partition.rs` has two `PartitionSpec`
  initializers missing the newly required `include_main_file` field. Required fix:
  initialize that field in both test records, then rerun `cargo test -p test_clang`.
  The independent `clang` fixture target also times out/fails broadly in the current
  dirty windows-rs worktree, so it is not used as batch closure evidence.
- Clean replay applied all 254 retained post-MIDL patches. `minwindef.h` and `windef.h`
  match exactly; `wtypes.h` differs only by a removed trailing blank line. `dxva9typ.h`
  and `newdev.h` remain pre-existing replay mismatches outside this batch and must be
  reconciled in their own queue entries.

## 2026-09-02T20:05:00Z - Batch existing-patches-01

- Headers: `appmgmt.h`, `aux_ulib.h`, `callobj.h`, `certenc.h`, and `cfgmgr32.h`.
- Classified retained supported-OS, set-last-error, and ABI-compatible semantic enum
  typing patches.
- Every retained artifact passes reverse application against its tracked patched header.
- These patches were present in the prior successful sequential x64, arm64, and x86
  generation checkpoint.
- Current windows-rs test-harness blockers remain recorded under the preceding batch and
  do not change the classification of these already generated artifacts.

## 2026-09-02T20:35:00Z - Batch resource-ownership-audit-01

- Started a full audit of every retained `*.zzz-resource-ownership.patch` artifact
  (11 headers: `AuthZ.h`, `bcrypt.h`, `ncrypt.h`, `ncryptprotect.h`, `NTSecAPI.h`,
  `NTSecPKG.h`, `securitybaseapi.h`, `sspi.h`, `wincrypt.h`, `winsafer.h`, `winsvc.h`) per
  the explicit instruction to not classify existing resource-ownership patches as closed
  if they still annotate typedefs.
- Headers: `NTSecPKG.h`, `securitybaseapi.h`, and `sspi.h`.
- Static audit (grep for `_Win32_metadata_raii_free_`/`_Win32_metadata_invalid_handle_`
  with surrounding context) confirms all three headers already place ownership annotations
  exclusively on producer `_Out_`/`_Out_opt_`/`_Outptr_` parameters, never on
  typedefs/`DECLARE_HANDLE` sites. These three are compliant with the corrected policy
  as-is; no code change was required, only classification.
- Remaining 8 headers in this audit set still annotate typedefs directly and require
  correction; they are being migrated in subsequent batches rather than closed here.
- Reverse patch checks (`git apply --check --reverse`) pass for all three retained
  artifacts.

## 2026-09-02T21:05:00Z - Batch resource-ownership-audit-02

- Headers: `NTSecAPI.h`, `ncryptprotect.h`, and `winsafer.h`.
- All three violated the corrected shared-handle ownership policy: `LSA_HANDLE`
  (`NTSecAPI.h`), `NCRYPT_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE`/`NCRYPT_STREAM_HANDLE` (`ncryptprotect.h`), and
  `SAFER_LEVEL_HANDLE` (`winsafer.h`) all carried invalid-handle/RAIIFree annotations
  directly on their typedef/`DECLARE_HANDLE` sites.
- Corrected each header in place: removed the typedef-level annotations and added
  equivalent invalid-handle/RAIIFree annotations to every producer `_Out_`/`_Out_opt_`
  output parameter that actually vends a new handle of that type, using close functions
  confirmed present in the same header (`LsaClose`, `NCryptCloseProtectionDescriptor`,
  `NCryptStreamClose`, `SaferCloseLevel`).
- Regenerated each patch artifact by reconstructing the pre-annotation baseline (reverse
  application of the prior non-compliant patch against the committed header, in an
  isolated working-tree copy) and re-diffing forward against the corrected header. This
  preserves unrelated already-compliant hunks in the same patch untouched (e.g.
  `NTSecAPI.h`'s `LsaRegisterLogonProcess`/`LsaLogonUser`/`LsaConnectUntrusted` groups).
- `git apply --check --reverse` passes for all three regenerated patches. Static audit
  (grep with context) confirms zero remaining `_Win32_metadata_raii_free_`/
  `_Win32_metadata_invalid_handle_` occurrences adjacent to a `typedef`/`DECLARE_HANDLE`
  site in any of the three headers.
- Remaining unresolved resource-ownership headers: `AuthZ.h`, `bcrypt.h`, `ncrypt.h`,
  `wincrypt.h`, `winsvc.h`. These are being migrated in subsequent batches.

## 2026-09-02T21:45:00Z - Batch resource-ownership-audit-03

- Headers: `AuthZ.h`, `winsvc.h`, and `bcrypt.h`.
- All three violated the corrected shared-handle ownership policy: seven AuthZ handle
  types, `SC_HANDLE`/`SERVICE_STATUS_HANDLE`, and five BCrypt handle types all carried
  invalid-handle/RAIIFree annotations directly on their typedef/`DECLARE_HANDLE` sites.
- `winsvc.h` required a new placement pattern: `SC_HANDLE` and `SERVICE_STATUS_HANDLE` are
  produced as direct function **return values**, not `_Out_` parameters. Adopted the
  trailing-attribute-after-closing-paren convention already established in this repo for
  function-pointer typedef return values (`NTSecPKG.h`), applied here to ordinary (non-typedef)
  function declarations for the first time.
- Two handle types (`AUTHZ_AUDIT_EVENT_TYPE_HANDLE` in `AuthZ.h`, base `BCRYPT_HANDLE` in
  `bcrypt.h`) have no producer function within their header; their invalid-handle
  annotations were dropped rather than misattached, and this is called out explicitly in
  each header report as an assumption rather than silently discarded.
- Regenerated each patch artifact by reconstructing the pre-annotation baseline (reverse
  application of the prior non-compliant patch) and re-diffing forward against the
  corrected header. `git apply --check --reverse` passes for all three regenerated patches.
- `bcrypt.h` has an independent `zz-crypto-security-enums` patch whose
  `BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider` hunk shares a 3-line context window with this change.
  Isolated reverse-check of that unrelated patch alone against the fully-patched file no
  longer succeeds (expected context-window collision, not a regression). Verified full
  sequential forward replay instead: pristine → `zz-crypto-security-enums.patch` → the
  regenerated `zzz-resource-ownership.patch` reproduces the exact corrected file with zero
  diff.
- Remaining unresolved resource-ownership headers: `ncrypt.h`, `wincrypt.h`. These are
  being migrated in subsequent batches.

## 2026-09-02T22:10:00Z - Batch resource-ownership-audit-04

- Header: `ncrypt.h` (single-header batch; the only remaining header in this audit set is
  `wincrypt.h`, which is large enough to warrant its own dedicated batch next).
- `NCRYPT_HANDLE` (base) and its four subtypes carried invalid-handle/RAIIFree annotations
  directly on their typedef sites. Unlike `bcrypt.h`, all subtypes here share one generic
  free function, `NCryptFreeObject`.
- Removed typedef-level annotations; added invalid-handle plus
  `_Win32_metadata_raii_free_(NCryptFreeObject)` to all 7 producer `_Out_`/`_Out_opt_`
  parameters (`NCryptOpenStorageProvider`, `NCryptOpenKey`, `NCryptCreatePersistedKey`,
  `NCryptImportKey`, `NCryptTranslateHandle` (2 out-params), `NCryptSecretAgreement`).
  `NCRYPT_HASH_HANDLE` has no producer or consumer anywhere in this header (declared but
  unused); its annotation was dropped rather than misattached.
- Regenerated the patch via pristine-baseline reconstruction. `git apply --check --reverse`
  passes. Verified full sequential forward replay (pristine → co-resident
  `zz-crypto-security-enums.patch` → the regenerated `zzz-resource-ownership.patch`)
  reproduces the exact corrected file with zero diff.
- Remaining unresolved resource-ownership header: `wincrypt.h` (6 handle types across a
  much larger file; tracked as its own batch next).

## 2026-09-02T22:40:00Z - Batch resource-ownership-audit-05

- Header: `wincrypt.h` — the final and largest header in the 11-header resource-ownership
  audit set (19.5k+ lines, plus a co-resident 104 KB `zz-crypto-security-enums` patch).
- Six handle typedefs (`HCRYPTPROV_OR_NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE`, `HCRYPTPROV_LEGACY`, `HCERTSTORE`,
  `HCERTSTOREPROV`, `HCRYPTASYNC`/`PHCRYPTASYNC`, `HCERTCHAINENGINE`) carried
  invalid-handle/RAIIFree annotations directly on their typedef sites.
- Removed typedef-level annotations; added invalid-handle (plus RAIIFree where a single
  unambiguous free function exists) to 12 producer groups: 1 for
  `HCRYPTPROV_OR_NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE`, 9 for `HCERTSTORE` (6 direct-return functions:
  `CertOpenStore`, `CertDuplicateStore`, `CryptGetMessageCertificates`,
  `CertOpenSystemStoreA`/`W`, `PFXImportCertStore`; 3 out-params: `CryptQueryObject`,
  `CryptRetrieveTimeStamp`, `CryptVerifyTimeStampSignature`), 1 for `HCRYPTASYNC`
  (`CryptCreateAsyncHandle` → `CryptCloseAsyncHandle`), 1 for `HCERTCHAINENGINE`
  (`CertCreateCertificateChainEngine` → `CertFreeCertificateChainEngine`).
- Deliberately did **not** add RAIIFree for `HCERTSTORE`: it is a reference-counted resource
  (`CertDuplicateStore` increments, `CertCloseStore` decrements), not a simple 1:1 RAII
  relationship, and the original (non-compliant) patch never specified one either — this fix
  preserves that design decision rather than inventing new semantics.
- `HCRYPTPROV_LEGACY` and `HCERTSTOREPROV` have no in-header producer (every occurrence is
  an `_In_`/`_Inout_` consumer or struct field); their invalid-handle annotations were
  dropped rather than misattached, called out explicitly as an assumption.
- Regenerated the patch via pristine-baseline reconstruction. `git apply --check --reverse`
  passes. Verified full sequential forward replay (pristine → the much larger co-resident
  `zz-crypto-security-enums.patch` → the regenerated `zzz-resource-ownership.patch`)
  reproduces the exact corrected file with zero diff, confirming no context-window
  collisions despite the enums patch's size.
- **All 11 headers in the resource-ownership audit set (`AuthZ.h`, `bcrypt.h`, `ncrypt.h`,
  `ncryptprotect.h`, `NTSecAPI.h`, `NTSecPKG.h`, `securitybaseapi.h`, `sspi.h`, `wincrypt.h`,
  `winsafer.h`, `winsvc.h`) are now compliant with the corrected shared-handle ownership
  policy and classified `accepted-normalized`.** This closes out the audit explicitly
  requested to correct or block resource-ownership patches that still annotate typedefs.

## 2026-09-02T23:05:00Z - Batch existing-patches-02

- Headers: `bluetoothapis.h`, `clfsmgmtw32.h`, `clfsw32.h`, `combaseapi.h`, and `comcat.h`.
- Resumed processing the general pending-header queue (189 pending headers already have
  retained post-MIDL patches) now that the full resource-ownership audit is closed.
- Classified retained `set-last-error` (3 headers) and `supported-os` (2 headers)
  annotation-only patches; none contain ownership/typedef metadata, so no code changes were
  required.
- Every retained artifact passes reverse application against its tracked patched header.
  These patches were present in the prior successful sequential x64, arm64, and x86
  generation checkpoint.
